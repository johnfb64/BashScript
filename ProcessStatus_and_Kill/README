HOW TO CREATE DUMMY PROCESS

-  Command: 

$ sleep 600

  
You can use the sleep command. Sleep command is used to delay for a fixed amount of time during the execution of any script.

After that you can check the process:

ps -fea | grep "sleep 600"

or

ps -fea | grep "sleep 600" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -I{} echo {} 

Then, you can kill the process

ps -fea | grep "sleep 600" | grep -v grep | awk '{print $2}' | xargs -I{} kill {}

* -v grep = filter the query process "ps -fea | grep sleep"
* aws '{print $2}' = Only take the second column of the output, in the case of command ps -fea is the ID of the process. 
* xargs -I = pass parameters to kill, in this case the ID process.
